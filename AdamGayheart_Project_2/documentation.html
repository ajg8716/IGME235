    <h1>OVERALL PROCESS</h1>
    <p>I hit a lot of speed bumps along the way. When I made my proposal I said I was going to create a Trivia Game using the trivia API listed in the Project2 description. However for some reason the link did not work for me when I tried to open it. So I decided to do the Giphy option instead. <br>I started by restyling the entire page. I decided to style my page with a Frutiger Aero aesthetic as I believe it matches the vibe of a GIF finder page. Next I implemented Pagination which took a lot of time to figure out on my own as I couldn't find a good tutorial to help me. I implemented the max searches per page at the same time as pagination. I then created a working recent searches drop down by myself. I implemented the spinning GIF. Then, lastly, I created the Copy to Clipboard button. <br> I have gone back and fixed a few things aswell. Small things here and there. However one major one is worth noting. I changed the banner. The one I was previously using was temporary and was replaced by a photo I have the rights to use.</p>
