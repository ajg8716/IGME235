            <h1>OVERALL PROCESS</h1>
            <p>I have had a lot of difficulty trying to understand PIXI.js. My proposal was a little ambitious but I got the gameplay to where I wanted it. Sadly I did not have more time for menus. I also rand into a weird bug where the playagain button wasn't wotking and it forced me to work a little passed the due time. I wish I had more time to add some more style to my menus and UI. the Stats page was a huge problme for me because I didn't realize why It was not displaying but I didn't realise that it was because all the text was set in setup so I had to move the code to the end function.</p>
