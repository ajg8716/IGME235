        <h2>My Bio</h2>
        <blockquote class="bio">My name is Adam Gayheart. I am a second year student at Rochester Institute of Technology. I like to play videogames, travel, play sports, play the cello, and work out. A goal of mine is to be a successful game developer. In this class, I want to gain knowledge and the skills to code and create in CSS and HTML. For my major, I want to succeed in my classes so that I am properly prepared to let my creativity run wild and make some fun games. At RIT, I want to get my diploma and then use that diploma to get a job in the gaming industry. I see myself working at a game company. I'm not 100% sure as to what I want to specialize in. </blockquote>
